Write 2-4 alternate solutions to this challenge.  In pseudocode, not in JS even if you want to!

These must be different from your main solution, and the solutions you studied.  Be sure to explain your solution.

Strategies:
1: pop the last letter into a new string, and repeat for each "new last letter" putting them in successive places until nothing is left

2: map each letter to numbers, reverse order of numbers, recomiple to string

3: count letter, repeat a function that many times which places each letter into a new string
